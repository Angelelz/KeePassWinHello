# [KeePassWinHello 3.0](https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/releases/tag/v3.0)

In this major release we have finally shipped a long-awaited feature for a permanent storage for master passwords ([#7](https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/issues/7)).
The storage holds its content encrypted with a permanent key signed with your biometry via Windows Hello.
Please follow to the Options dialog and create a permanent key in order to enable this storage. Thanks to _gio710_ and many others.
In addition, you can revoke all stored keys manually on the Options ([#10](https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/issues/10), thanks to _ghost_).

And now here is the most significant change ever. Let us introduce our brand-new ultimate icon!ðŸŽˆ
