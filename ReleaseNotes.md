# [KeePassWinHello 3.1.1](https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/releases/tag/v3.1.1)

Fixed the security issue found by _Angelelz_ [#38](https://github.com/sirAndros/KeePassWinHello/issues/38).
It allowed to execute a spoofing attack by replacing the permanent key used to sign master passwords while storing in the Windows Credential Manager. Big thanks to [Angelelz](https://github.com/Angelelz)!
